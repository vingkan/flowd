## flowd
FlowD app for debaters, started during Nationals for Speech and Debate in June 2014 at Overland Park, Kansas.

## Motivation
"Flowing" is a process in competitive debate used to track arguments, show clash of ideas, and identify gaps in analysis. Most debaters keep a rigorous flow on a legal pad or by using Microsoft Excel. During the final days of the National Tournament, I went through a cycle of creating and testing this web-based flow pad on other competitors as challenge in developing a debater-friendly user interface.

## Takeaways
Some lessons I learned from my sample users:
    o  Keyboard shortcuts are essential for high speed flow: the mouse should practically never be used.
    o  Saving the flow after a round is not a high priority, but if there were a tool to analyze saved flows, it would be more desirable.
    o  Debate jargon is often shortened, sometimes to single letters (critique -> k) with remarkable similarity among debaters from across the country.
    o Most users appreciate color-coded flows.
    o Being able to share a flow with a teammate during a round is a high priority.
